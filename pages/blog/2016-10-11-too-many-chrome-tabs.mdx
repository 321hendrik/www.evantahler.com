Here’s a fun bug report:

![](/images/medium-export/1__QX3Wun3NN__374jHq__VsngA.png)

After talking further with @bluesunrise, it turns out that this error only appeared on his development machine, and even more specifically, only when the Crome browser was open!

This is a problem with the [node-resque](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque) project, which, among other things, is used by [ActionHero](http://www.actionherojs.com/) to enqueue and work background tasks. One of the things Resque does is that on boot, it asks Redis (the backing store for this data) what workers it thinks are are running on this host. We do this to check to see if any old workers have crashed while working on a job… and if they have, we:

- Move the job they were working on into an "error” list for introspection
- Remove the old crashed worker process from Redis

To check which workers this host can manage, all workers have the system’s "hostname” saved, and we can look at what PID they were running as. If that PID no longer exists on this host, we can assume the worker has crashed and clean up the data as described above.

This means our Node.JS process needs to check on all the running PIDs on my system. Here’s how we **used** to do it (simplified):

```js
worker.prototype.getPids = function(callback){
  var cmd = 'ps awx';
  var child = exec(cmd, function(error, stdout, stderr){
    var pids = [];
    stdout.split('\n').forEach(function(line){
      line = line.trim();
      if(line.length > 0){
        var pid = parseInt(line.split(' ')[0]);
        if(!isNaN(pid)){ pids.push(pid); }
      }
    });
    if(!error && stderr){ error = stderr; }
      callback(error, pids);
    });
  });
};
```

Check out **ps awx**. We are asking the OS for the whole process list, and then extracting all the PIDs… which does accomplish our goal. To compare, check out how Ruby’s Resque does the same job:

```ruby
def linux_worker_pids
  `ps -A -o pid,command | grep -E "[r]esque:work|[r]esque:\sStarting|[r]esque-[0-9]" | grep -v "resque-web"`.split("\n").map do |line|
    line.split(' ')[0]
  end
end
```

Ruby has the luxury of _knowing_ that the name of the process running this application will be called "Resque”. However, for the Node.JS version, it might be called "node”, but it also might be called "electron”, or "iojs”. Since we can’t be sure of the process name, this means we need to look at _all_ processes.

When you look at _all_ processes on a system, there might be a lot of them… I learned that @bluesunrise had a \*lot\* of tabs open in Chrome. Every tab in counts as a process. Also, the process list contains a lot of data: the PID, the name, the path, etc. After about 10,000 characters, Node.JS’ Buffers start to get full, and apparently in some cases, crash.

So now we know the source of the problem, how do we fix it? Since Node.JS’s parsing of the large string returned by the sub-process was the problem, can we off-load this work? We can!

```js
var cmd = "ps -ef | awk '{print $2}'";
```

Here, rather than load in _all_ the data from **ps**, we are using AWK to return only the process IDs. AWK is a safe choice, because It is part of the kernel, and thus available on all unix/Linux/OSX distributions. This returns a far shorter string back to Node.JS to parse.

Hooray!
