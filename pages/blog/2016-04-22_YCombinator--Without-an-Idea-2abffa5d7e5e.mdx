I have decided to apply for the Summer 2012 class of YCombinator as a "[founder without an idea](http://ycombinator.com/noidea.html)".

As part of the application process, the applicants (typically a team of already tight co-founders) are instructed to create a ~ 1 minute video explaining their idea. As I am applying solo, and without an idea, creating the video was a rather awkward process. I decided to spend 1/2 my time going over my credentials, and the other half talking about an "area of interest" which I hope to be able to investigate with YCâ€™s help. Of course my "area of interest" is in the video game space

Here is my application video:
