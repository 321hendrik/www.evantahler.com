I’ve been pretty bad at posting lately, but that’s not to say that I haven’t been busy!

Since we last spoke, I’ve joined [TaskRabbit](http://taskrabbit.com) as their senior systems engineer. I get to play with ruby, node, cloud hosts (Joyent), BI, and everything in between. I’ll have more to say soon!
