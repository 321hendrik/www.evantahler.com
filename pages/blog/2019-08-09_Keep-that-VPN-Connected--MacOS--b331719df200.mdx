I recently found myself regularly traveling, and I wanted to ensure that no matter when I opened my laptop, that my wifi connection would be secure. However, there’s no way using built-in OSX VPN client to connect on boot or wake-from-sleep, nor is there any way retry after the failure of your VPN connection. _Good thing that Apple made AppleScript!_

I have a personal VPN server running on a 5$/mo [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) server which is configured with this amazing script: [https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn](https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn]%28https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn%29). I’ve got my VPN configured in the MacOS Network settings as \`vpn-evan\` and I’ve got "all network traffic" going though it. That **_should_** keep me safe…

### Create the Reconnection Script

Open \`Script Editor\` and paste in the following:

Let’s break dow this script:
**_1\._** _When the application is idle
_**_2\._** _Find your VPN connection
_**_3\._** _If it’s disconnected, beep at us (so we know what’s happening), and then try to connect
_**_4\._** _Sleep for 60 seconds and check again_

Be sure to replace "vpn-evan"" above with the name of your VPN connection

So if this program is always running in the background, every minute, you will try to connect to your VPN!

### Configure the Application to Run at Boot

Now, we want to turn this little script into a program.

**1\.** In \`Script Editor\`, go to "export" and save your script as an "application". Click "Stay open after Run Handler"

**2\.** Open up \`System Preferences\` and then navigate to "Users" and "Startup Items". Drag and Drop your new application there!

That’s it!
