As a final update to this, version 14.0.1 has been removed from NPM, and 14.0.2 is released.

We’ve gone back to building the Redis connections inside the an actionhero initializer, but you can now pass a constructor and arguments in. There’s a third option (\`buildNew\`) which is needed to help deal with all the different (and incompatible) ways that the various redis packages want to create their client object… which is where this whole problem came from in the first place!

For example:

- [fakeredis](https://github.com/hdachev/fakeredis): _var client = require("fakeredis").createClient(port, host);_
- [redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis): _var client = require("redis").createClient(port, host);_
- [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) (single): _var client = new require("ioredis")(port, host);_
- [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) (sentinel): _var client = new require("ioredis")({"sentinels":\[{host: host, port: port}\], name: "my_cluster"});_
- [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) (cluster): \_var client = new require("ioredis").\_Cluster(\[{port: port,host: host})

Because of all these differences, we can’t homogenize how actionhero passes configuration to the constructors…. or even know what the constructors should be! Also, as a bonus, "constructor" is a reserved word in JS, so we’ve moved to "konstructor"

The final [config/redis.con](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/blob/master/config/redis.js)f we landed on now looks like:

var host = process.env.REDIS_HOST || '127.0.0.1';
var port = process.env.REDIS_PORT || 6379;
var db = process.env.REDIS_DB || 0;
var password = process.env.REDIS_PASS || null;

exports\['default'\] = {
redis: function(api){

    // konstructor: The redis client constructor method
    // args: The arguments to pass to the constructor
    // buildNew: is it \`new konstructor()\` or just \`konstructor()\`?

    if(process.env.FAKEREDIS === 'false' || process.env.REDIS\_HOST !== undefined){

      return {
        '\_toExpand': false,
        client: {
          konstructor: require('ioredis'),
          args: \[{ port: port, host: host, password: password, db: db }\],
          buildNew: true
        },
        subscriber: {
          konstructor: require('ioredis'),
          args: \[{ port: port, host: host, password: password, db: db }\],
          buildNew: true
        },
        tasks: {
          konstructor: require('ioredis'),
          args: \[{ port: port, host: host, password: password, db: db }\],
          buildNew: true
        }
      };

    }else{

      return {
        '\_toExpand': false,
        client: {
          konstructor: require('fakeredis').createClient,
          args: \[port, host, {fast: true}\],
          buildNew: false
        },
        subscriber: {
          konstructor: require('fakeredis').createClient,
          args: \[port, host, {fast: true}\],
          buildNew: false
        },
        tasks: {
          konstructor: require('fakeredis').createClient,
          args: \[port, host, {fast: true}\],
          buildNew: false
        }
      };

    }

}
};

This is a far more complex configuration than I would have liked, but at least we now can offer actionhero users the flexibility to connect to all the possible flavors of redis.
