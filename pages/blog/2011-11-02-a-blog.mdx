Yep, I made a blog.

#### CHANGELOG

- I started this blog on a self-hosted [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) installation on [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) in November of 2011
- In December of 2012 I moved the blog to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting
- In April of 2015 I moved the whole thing to [Medium](https://medium.com/).
- In July of 2021 I moved the whole thing to back to my own site as a next.js + markdown site.
