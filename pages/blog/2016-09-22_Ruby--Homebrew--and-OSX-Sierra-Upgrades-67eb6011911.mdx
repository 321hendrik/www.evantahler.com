Say you are a developer and you recently updated to OSX Sierra…

You may encounter an error like this when doing anything with ruby, even booting up _IRB_:

undefined method \`default_gems_use_full_paths?'

If you are a [HomeBrew](http://brew.sh/) user, this will cause everything to break :(

After much googling, this error is the result of you having installed a newer version of ruby-gems (or a patch) against your **_system_** version of ruby. There is an easy fix!

Remove any installs of ruby-gems or any ruby-gems patches against the system version of ruby; ie: remove/rename everything in \`/Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0\` and try again.

You shouldn’t have any other gems in there (other than perhaps a runner like _rake_), so you shouldn’t have any gems to re-install. You _should_ be using a ruby version manager like [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage all of your gems anyway :D
