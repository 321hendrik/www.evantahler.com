Today we released the [first-ever security release for ActionHero.](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/releases/tag/v15.1.2) Details can be found below:

### 404 Web Request with malicious file name

Previously, the default error responder when a client asked for a static-file which was missing (404) returned the name the of that file

```js
api.config.errors.fileNotFound = function (connection) {
  return connection.localize([
    "That file is not found (%s)",
    connection.params.file,
  ]);
};
```

This is dangerous because a malicious actor could request a filename with an executable javascript tag and harm the requester. We now will no longer return the file name:

```js
api.config.errors.fileNotFound = function (connection) {
  return connection.localize(["That file is not found"]);
};
```

### Malicious callback provided when requesting an action via JSONp

When requesting an action via JSONp, it was possible (though unlikely) that the `callback` string you were providing contained malicious javascript which would harm the requester. We will now sanitize the provided `callback` in the following way:

```js
function callbackHtmlEscape(str) {
  return str
    .replace(/&/g, "&amp;")
    .replace(/"/g, "&quot;")
    .replace(/'/g, "&#39;")
    .replace(/</g, "&lt;")
    .replace(/>/g, "&gt;")
    .replace(/\)/g, "")
    .replace(/\(/g, "");
}
```

This fix has been back-ported to:

- ActionHero V14 @ [v14.0.12](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/releases/tag/v14.0.12)
- ActionHero v13 @ [v13.4.5](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/releases/tag/v13.4.5)

A huge thank you to [@submitteddenied](https://github.com/submitteddenied) is earned for reporting these issues and working to fix them.
