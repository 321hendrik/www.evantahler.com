We’ve had a simple [ActionHero demo site](http://demo.actionherojs.com) for a while now, which shows how easy it is to get started with the framework, but until now, we’ve not had a "real world app" example… and it is time that we did!

This project shows off how to use a number of more ‘advanced’ features, like session persistence and sharing between HTTP and Web Sockets on the same page, authenticating your actions, etc.
