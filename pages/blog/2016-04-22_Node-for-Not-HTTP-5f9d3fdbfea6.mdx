On Thursday 2014–12–04 I gave a talk as the [SF Node.js Club](http://www.meetup.com/Node-js-Serverside-Javascripters-Club-SF/events/209529622) entitled "Node for Not HTTP".

The talk gave an overview of some of the cool things you can do with node.js that are not related to websites. To do this, I cobbled together an [ActionHero](http://www.actionherojs.com) project that would take input form HTTP, WebSockets, Telnet, and twitter which allowed us to turn a desk lamp on and off.

I taught a room about the [DMX lighting protocol](https://github.com/evantahler/node_for_not_http/blob/master/dmx.js) and how to build an ActionHero server in 20 minutes!
