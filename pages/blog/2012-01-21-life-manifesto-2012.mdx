A Life Manifesto is a collection of short "bullet points" which describe what your goals in life/love/society are and how you might approach those goals. Think of it like a mini-mission-statement. Here is my life manifesto for January 2012. This will evolve over time.

Writing this type of document was incredibly hard, even though it turned out to be only ~100 words.

- **Life**: If it makes a good story, it was worth it.
- **Religion**: I am fairly certain life is a "The Sims" game and God got bored a long time ago.
- **_Politics_**_:_ If I could pass one law, it would be to make it illegal for any politician to mention religion.
- **_The Secret of Life_** *:* Have fun first and if there is time, leave the world a better place than you found it. There will be time.
- **Education**: The best weapon we have to fight ignorance and intolerance is education. You can’t change the current generation, but you can steal the future right out from under them.
- **Food**: I am on top of the food chain, so I’ll act that way.
- **Piracy**: People pirate because the content was too hard to obtain & use legally, not because I want the artist to starve.
- **Media Distribution**: Most people will choose access over quality.
- **Ownership**: Why do I need to own it if I have access to it?
- **Gamification:** Gamification done poorly is obvious, Gamification done well is simply a game.
- **Games**: Games are neither innately good nor bad. They can be used to train killers or teach compassion. Lets make them awesome.

I like this. I think I’ll put this on my about page.
