I’ve been traveling a lot for work, and I thought it might be cool to somehow signal where I was **physically** when checking in code. I knew my Mac has a Geolocation framework, but I couldn’t figure out a way to access it via the command line.

Then I found the wonderful [WherAmI](https://github.com/robmathers/WhereAmI) project! It’s a simple wrapper around the [CoreLocation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_SDK#Core_Location) framework that spits out your lat/lng.

From there, it’s a [simple task](https://github.com/evantahler/git-whereami) to pass that up to the Google Geocoding API to get a street address!

Here’s the readme from [evantahler/git-whereami](https://github.com/evantahler/git-whereami)

[**evantahler/git-whereami**](https://github.com/evantahler/git-whereami)

_Append your location to all of our git commits!_

Do you travel a lot? Would you team be interested to know where your code is coming from? Then this is for you!

#### Install whereami

Head on over to [https://github.com/robmathers/WhereAmI](https://github.com/robmathers/WhereAmI) and download the whereami excecutable. Place it in your home folder, like ~/whereami

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# prepare-commit-msg

WHEREAMI="$HOME/whereami"

LAT=`$WHEREAMI | grep Latitude  | awk -F" " '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'`
LNG=`$WHEREAMI | grep Longitude | awk -F" " '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'`

URL="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=$LAT,$LNG&sensor=false"
ADDRESS=`eval "curl -s \"$URL\" | grep formatted_address | head -n 1 | sed 's/\"//g' | sed 's/,//g'"`
ADDRESS=`echo $ADDRESS | awk -F' : ' '{print $2}'`
DATE=`date`

printf "\n"                      >> $1
printf "This commit coded at:\n" >> $1
printf "---------------------\n" >> $1
printf "$ADDRESS\n"              >> $1
printf "$LAT, $LNG\n"            >> $1
printf "@ $DATE\n"               >> $1
```

#### Setup whereami

In whichever git repository you want to use this on, copy the prepare-commit-msg into ~/PROJECT/.git/hooks.

**That’s it!**

Now, whenever you make a git commit, we will use whereami to source your lat/lng, and then ask Google’s geocoder what your address is, resulting in:

```raw
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 4 commits.
#   (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   newfile
#
