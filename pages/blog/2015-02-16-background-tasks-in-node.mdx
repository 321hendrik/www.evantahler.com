On Thursday 2015–02–05 I gave a talk as the awesome [SFNode Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sfnode/) entitled "Background Jobs for NodeJS".

![](/images/medium-export/0__p6PmuaW4OvZfk7wd.jpg)

The talk gave an overview of some of the many ways you can preform background tasks in node, which include:

- Foreground (in-line)
- Parallel (threaded-ish)
- Local Messages (fork-ish)
- Remote Messages
- Remote Queues (Resque-ish)
- Event Bus (Kafka-ish)

For every section, we show an example, and more interestingly, note how node makes every step better/faster/stronger… even the bad ideas!

The idea for the talk came from a twitter conversation with [Dan Shaw](https://medium.com/u/7c861ae496fa), host of [NodeUP](http://nodeup.com/) about how easy it was to have multiple node workers in [Node-Resque](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque)… Check out the presentation to learn how!
