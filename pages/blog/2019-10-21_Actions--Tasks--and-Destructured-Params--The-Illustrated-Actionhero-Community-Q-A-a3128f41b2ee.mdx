Welcome to the fourth installment of The Illustrated [Actionhero](https://www.actionherojs.com/) Community Q&A!

Every week in October I’ll be publishing a conversation from the [Actionhero Slack community](http://slack.actionherojs.com/) that highlights both a feature of the Actionhero Node.JS framework and the robustness of the community’s responses… and adding some diagrams to help explain the concept.

### Online and Offline Sync

[Source conversation in Slack](https://actionherojs.slack.com/archives/C04EVSUSD/p1566736126151100)

Actionhero community member Nick asks:

> I’ve noticed when running the latest AH, if I destructure the data param in an action run function to `{params, response, connection}`, when I write the output to response my endpoint returns nothing, unless I do an `Object.assign()`. Is this expected behavior?

After some back and forth with other members of the community

> …honestly I’ve seen this behavior for some time, since the move to async and ES6… I believe around AH 17

First… what is destructuring?

> Destructuring is a programming shorthand to simply variable assignment by "breaking" the structure of complex objects or arrays.

For example, these are valid examples of destructing:

In both cases, we’ve set the variables `firstName` and `lastName` without having to reach "into" the complex array or object. To learn more about all the cool things destructuring can do, I recommend [this excellent article by the team at Mozilla](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/05/es6-in-depth-destructuring/).

Lets take a look at the Action in question:

const {Action, api} = require('actionhero')

module.exports = class ListAvailableLessonDays extends Action {
constructor () {
super()
this.name = 'ListAvailableLessonDays'
this.description = 'Description'
this.inputs = {
gradeNumber: { required: true }
}
}

async run ({params, response}) {
const { gradeNumber } = params;
const { LessonService } = api.services;
const { getAvailableLessonDays } = LessonService;
const lessons = await getAvailableLessonDays(gradeNumber);
response = lessons; // <-- problem!
}
}

Nick is building a tool to help teachers manage their curriculums. A requestor provides a `gradeNumber` and the API then returns a list of saved lessons. They are destrucuring the input object `data` to his run method into `params` and `response`.

We can see the data passed into an an Action’s run method:

Since Actonhero can handle connections from many different types of connections (http, websocket, direct TCP socket, etc), we need a generic way to represent the request to an action. Inside Actionhero, we have multiple types of servers responsible for handling each type of connection, and building a generic `connection` object, and figuring out what the request `parameters` (or `params` for short) are. The server is also responsible for sending the `response` of your action back to the client. To make a simple API for all of this, your actions `run` method is passed one big `data` object with everything you might need.

data = {
connection: connection,
action: 'randomNumber',
toProcess: true,
toRender: true,
messageId: 123,
params: { action: 'randomNumber', apiVersion: 1 },
actionStartTime: 123, response: {},
}

To learn more about how actions work, the [Action Tutorial](https://docs.actionherojs.com/tutorial-actions.html) has a lot of great information.

Nick continues his investigation:

> This code returns an empty response If I leave it as data, and then do `data.response = lessons`, it returns the array as expected or if I do an `Object.assign(response, lessons)`, it will return the data but with the array converted to an object, for obvious reasons

Said another way…

… why?

Community member Chad saves the day:

> This is standard ES6 behavior, a common gotcha. When you destructure you take a reference to the property in question. It is a pointer to it. If you say `response = lessons` you overwrite the POINTER, not the VALUE OF IT.

> You are "repointing" your local var response to point to a local value lessons, not altering the pointer within the original data object. You could safely set `response.someValue`. But not overwrite the entire response itself.

So, if you are adding properties to `response`, (like `response.message)`, you can use a restructured response, but if you are overwriting the entire response object, you should not destructure the inputs to your Action’s`run` method.
