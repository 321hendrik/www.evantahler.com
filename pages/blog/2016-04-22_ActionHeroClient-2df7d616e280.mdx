Just a quick note that there now exists a [client library](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero_client) for [actionHero](http://actionherojs.com) in nodeJS. I’m also working on examples for other languages. If you have any requests, leave me a note on github or the comments here.

I’m fairly proud of this one because it allows the client to make a number of async requests to the server and be called-back in the proper manner when they complete. These responses may come out of order or between other client-side events (like someone else in your room chatting). This works because actionHero already has a request counter which I extended in the project to maintain the responses IDs in order.

This means if you ask for slowMethod then fastMethod, you will get 2 responses from the sever, but odds are the first response you get will be for fastMethod. However, that response will be ID #2 and when you finally get slowMethod, it will be with ID #1. Callbacks are stored in the client library and sent off once the correct response is generated.

npm install actionhero_client

Enjoy!
