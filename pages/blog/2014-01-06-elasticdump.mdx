### Intro

At [TaskRabbit](http://www.taskrabbit.com), we use [ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org) for a number of things (which include search of course). In our development, we follow the normal pattern of having a few distinct environments which we use to build and test our code. The ‘acceptance’ environment is supposed to be a mirror of production, including having a copy of its data. However, we could not find a good tool to help us copy our Elastic Search indices… [so we made one](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump)!

[**taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump**](https://github.com/taskrabbit/elasticsearch-dump)

### Use

elasticdump works by sending an input to an output. Both can be either an elasticsearch URL or a File.

- Elasticsearch:
  - format: `{proticol}://{host}:{port}/{index}`
  - example: `http://127.0.0.1:9200/my_index`
- File:
  - format: `{FilePath}`
  - example: `/Users/evantahler/Desktop/dump.json`

You can then do things like:

Copy an index from production to staging:

```bash
elasticdump --input=http://production.es.com:9200/my_index --output=http://staging.es.com:9200/my_index
```

Backup an index to a file:

```bash
elasticdump --input=http://production.es.com:9200/my_index --output=/var/dat/es.json
```

### Options

- — input (required) (see above)
- — output (required) (see above)
- — limit how many objects to move in bulk per operation (default: 100)
- — debug display the elasticsearch commands being used (default: false)
- — delete delete documents one-by-one from the input as they are moved (default: false)

### Notes

- elasticdump (and elasticsearch in general) will create indices if they don’t exist upon import
- we are using the put method to write objects. This means new objects will be created and old objects with the same ID will be updated
- the file transport will overwrite any existing files
- If you need basic http auth, you can use it like this: — input=http://name:password@production.es.com:9200/my_index
