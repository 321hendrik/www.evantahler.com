Sometimes you want to delete a cookie you’ve previously set from the server. This might even be the \`sessionID\` cookie that [ActionHero](http://www.actionherojs.com) sets for all clients.

Removing it is easy from an action:

This will remove the cookie entirely. There is no "delete" operation on cookies, but all browsers respect the expire option. Here we are setting the expire date to be way in the past (1970 specifically).

ActionHero will regenerate a new SessionID for the client on the next request.

Enjoy!
