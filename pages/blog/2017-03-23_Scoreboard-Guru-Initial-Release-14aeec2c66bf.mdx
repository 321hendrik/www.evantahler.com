I’m happy to announce the initial release of [**Scoreboard Guru**](https://www.scoreboard.guru)!

### What is Scoreboard Guru?

> Scoreboard Guru is the best way to keep track of your scores in all your games & sports!

> You can see your performance over time, compare with your friends, and export your scores. Scoreboard Guru is easy to use, and backs up all of your data on our servers so all your history is safe & available on all your devices.

I’m a nerd, and I play a lot of board games. I’ve always wondered how I compared to the rest of my friends and family. I built Scoreboard Guru to not only keep track of my scores over time, but also to allow friends to compare their performance with each-other and see how they stack up.

### Where did Scoreboard Guru come from?

There are a /number/ of score-keeping apps out there, but none of them had all the features I wanted. Scoreboard Guru’s unique features include:

- Cloud backup & sync so you can view your scores across multiple devices, and, if a friend is tracking this game, your scores will still be counted.
- Geo-tagging, location-tagging, and image upload. You can remember the name of that game you played at Sally’s house a few months back!
- Export & Sharing. While all your scores are stored on our servers, you can always share your matches online, and export your data as a CSV.
- Offline works too! There’s nothing worse than not being able to use an app just because your cell connection stops working. With Scoreboard Guru, you can store (many) in-progress games on your phone, and then upload them when you get back online.

### How can I get Scoreboard Guru?

I wanted to make Scoreboard Guru simple to use, and accessible. That’s why I’m happy to report that Scoreboard Guru is free to try. Just download the app and sign up, and you will be able to create up to 3 games and matches. After that, it’s only $2 to unlock the app… on all your devices!

Head on over to [www.scoreboard.guru](http://www.scoreboard.guru) (yes, .guru is a real top-level domain name), and give it a shot!
