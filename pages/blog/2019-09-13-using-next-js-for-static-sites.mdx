On Thursday, September 12, 2019 I gave a talk at [Seattle.js](https://twitter.com/seattlejs/) about how to use some of the free tools in the Javascript & open-source ecosystems to host static website.

This talk was inspired by a group of students learning to code in Seattle who were being taught tools like React and Angular, but struggling to learn how to deploy their sites using modern methods. Specifically, how to set up CI/CD (Continuous Integration + Continuous Deployment) and HTTPS. Though my work on [ActionHero,](http://www.actionherojs.com) an open source project, we’ve come up with some best practices to accomplish all of this for free!

Thanks to the free tools from Github, CircleCI and Zeit, it’s pretty easy to get production-grade infrastructure for smaller projects… for free!
