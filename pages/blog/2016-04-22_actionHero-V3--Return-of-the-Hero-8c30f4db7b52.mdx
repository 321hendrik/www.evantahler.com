Here’s what’s new:

- WebSockets. You can use them over http or https, and they are now a first-class member of the actionHero toolkit. We use the socket.io library so you can gracefully fall back to flash or ajax.
- Better Configuration Tools. You can now enable/disable any of the transports you want. There was also some major refactoring to make it easy to add more transports in the future.
- A sweet new logo (see above). [Thanks Ali!](http://www.alispagnola.com/)
- A better ChatRoom bus which can be shared by all types of persistent clients. You can telnet in and chat with your friend who is using web sockets on their phone.
- General Bug Fixing

This release also marks the point where I feel the API is mature enough that I feel comfortable doing some "PR" for it, and trying to get real people using it. This means that I’ll be even more attentive to bug fixes and feature requests, so send them my way!

As always, check out [http://actionherojs.com](http://actionherojs.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com/evantahler/actionHero) for the details.
