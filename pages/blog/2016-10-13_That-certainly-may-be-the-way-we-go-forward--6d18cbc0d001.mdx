That certainly may be the way we go forward! I \*think\* that on Solaris the PS command can’t accept those flags (you’ll note that the ruby version has a special solaris handler as well, in addition to windows as both versions have).

So this method \*might\* save us the trouble of needing something special for Solaris. That said, I’m not an expert on Solaris… anyone out there know for sure?
