Data Science vs Analytics are two related disciplines in most modern companies. I’ve heard a number of ways to describe the distinctions between the two, but they rarely have consensus. Here are the definitions I’ve synthesized over my career:

**Analytics:** The practice of analyzing data to explain why a behavior took place.

**Data Science**: The practice of using data to influence behavior.

So, say you worked for a streaming video company:

The **Analytics** team would explain why, all of a sudden, old re-runs of Frasier are very popular.

The **Data Science** team would write the "_… you might also like_" part of the application to indicate that because you liked other 90’s sitcoms, you might also like Frasier.
