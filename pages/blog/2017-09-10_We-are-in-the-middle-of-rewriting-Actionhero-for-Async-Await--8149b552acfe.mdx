We are in the middle of rewriting Actionhero for Async/Await. It’s going to be awesome when it’s done, but it will break all backwards compatibility. A major Semver bump doesn’t seem like enough… do we make a new project? Try to keep a previous branch alive?

What are your thoughts on this kind of thing?
