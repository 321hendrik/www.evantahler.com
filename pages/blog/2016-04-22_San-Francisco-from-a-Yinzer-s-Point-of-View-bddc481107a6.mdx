I have a hard time answering the question "where are you from?". I’ve lived in over 15 different homes in 8 cities. I was born in New Jersey, went to high school in Pennsylvania, and currently live in California. I have decided that for me, the question "where are you from" is equivalent to "where have you lived the longest?". For me, that’s Pittsburgh PA.

There’s more to the question "Where are you from?" than duration of occupation. It implies that the place you are from has had some meaningful impact on your way of thinking and (potentially) upbringing. I’ve noticed that Pittsburgh also fits the bill for that with me as well (and its deeper than loving Perogi). Without getting too philosophical here, I’ve noticed that I tend to use Pittsburgh as my "measuring stick" when comparing cities. I do this so much so, that I have started to think of San Francisco neighborhoods as their Pittsburgh equivalents. It turns out that there are a lot of people in San Francisco that have passed though Pittsburgh, and liked this notion.

I am proud to present to you version 1 of
