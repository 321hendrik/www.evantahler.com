Hi Google!

Google Forms is a great product. It allows just about anyone (academics, companies, government agencies) to create an online form to do research. It’s free, and it is great!

A common use case is capturing demographic data. When asking about gender, an inclusive best practice, according to the [Human Rights Campaign](https://www.hrc.org/resources/collecting-transgender-inclusive-gender-data-in-workplace-and-other-surveys) is to provide the following options:

```raw
What is your Gender Identity?

* Male
* Female
* Non-binary / Third Gender
* Prefer not to say
* Prefer to self-describe: ____________
```

Note how the last option is a free-form text field. One of the important things keep in mind when asking a question about _who you are_ is not to alienate anyone. Using the word "other" makes people feel… like _others_. With that in mind, check out how the following question (a radio selection with a free-text option) is displayed in a Google Form:

It would be great if Google Forms allowed the customization of the label on the final, free-text, entry field.

Thanks!
