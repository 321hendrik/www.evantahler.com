On Monday 2015–07–14 I gave a (remote) talk as the [**Pittsburg Code & Supply Meetup**](http://www.codeandsupply.co) entitled "TaskRabbit’s Ansible Tips & Tricks”.

The talk gave an overview of the journey TaskRabbit took from simple bash scrips, to Chef, and then to Ansible. I share some of the tips and tricks we learned along the way, and some hacks to make your team more efficient.
