A quick post to say that I’m very happy about where [ActionHero](http://actionherojs.com) is going.

The goals of the 7.x.x release have almost all been met!

The target for the 8.x.x release is to finally build out a modular plug-in system for common "packs" of actions and initializers. This includes authentication, database connections, etc.

To make the resque move, we created the [node-reque](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque) package which other folks at [TaskRabbit](http://taskrabbit.com) have been helping with.

[**taskrabbit/node-resque**
\_node-resque - It's Resque... For node!\_github.com](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque "https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque")[](https://github.com/taskrabbit/node-resque)

On the community side, we are no getting over 1K downloads a month from NPM! We also gained a number of [committers](https://github.com/evantahler/actionhero/network/members) to actionHero core over the last month. I’m considering doing an actionHero meet up (perhaps physical or virtual) in the near future. Any recommendations?
