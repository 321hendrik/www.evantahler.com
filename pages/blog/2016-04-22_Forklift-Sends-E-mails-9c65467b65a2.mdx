A quick note that Forklift now can send emails! A common request we had was the ability to send summary emails and at the end of a forklift ETL run, and now you can! We use ERB for email templates, and you can pass in variables that come from ruby or mySQL. As an added bonus, the email template will automagically format mySQL tables (multi-row results).

forklift**.**templated*email({
:to **\=>** STRING, *\# The recipient of the email*
:subject **\=>** STRING, *\# The subject of the email*
:template **\=>** STRING, *\# The path to the ERB template file*
:variables **\=>** { *\# Symbolized hash*
:KEY **\=>** VALUE, *\# > if VALUE is a string which contains "select", the SQL statement will be evaluated on the final DB*
:KEY **\=>** VALUE, *\# > otherwise, the litteral value will be passed to the template as a string\_
}
})
