[Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) is raising money to keep their free community continues integration server up and running. This is an awesome service which I use to test my node projects.

> _I’m lazy. Without Travis, I wouldn’t test. Travis makes it easy to test. Testing is good. Q.E.D. Travis is Good / Throws money at screen_
