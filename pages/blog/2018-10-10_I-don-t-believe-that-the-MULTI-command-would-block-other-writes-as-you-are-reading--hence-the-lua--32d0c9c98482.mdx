I don’t believe that the MULTI command would block other writes as you are reading… hence the lua script which would block other commands from changing the data mid-operation… but I’m not sure how Multi works in current versions of Redis (I haven’t taken a deep look since v2).

All the code in this talk is "for example". There are lots of error cases, etc that aren’t handled. If you are considering Redis as an alternative to Kafka, I would suggest you consider Persistance and Throuput. Do you need \*every\* write persisted to disk? Do you need to scale your reads past what one (even fast node) can handle?
